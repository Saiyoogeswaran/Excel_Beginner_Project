# 📊 Data Jobs Calculator — Excel Dashboard Project

This project is a hands-on replication of the Excel dashboard walkthrough by **Luke Barousse**, designed to explore data-related job roles, salaries, and job schedules across the United States. I followed his tutorial step-by-step and recreated the dashboard independently to reinforce my Excel skills and dashboard design thinking.
